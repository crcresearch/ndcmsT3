# Faculty Cluster Partnership Program

This general guidance is subject to frequent revision as the role of research computing at the University of Notre Dame evolves. The needs of the faculty, departments, and colleges along with the strategic goals of the university administration will continue to shape and redefine these guidelines. Further, factors external to this university such as directives from national funding agencies (DOE, NSF, DOD, NIH, etc..) will directly impact these guidelines.

## Purchasing Dedicated Servers

If the general workflow of utilizing the CRC's general access resources works for your research group and there is a need for more computing resources (additional machines) or a desire to decrease queued job wait times, the Cluster Partnership Program may be the next step.

With regards to the HPC equipment, the CRC provides engineering support and services in the form maintenance and system administration. For those wishing to purchase servers through the CRC, total department/college/university operating costs are reduced through centralized maintenance of these clusters when compared to in-house management or cloud infrastructure. Further, research groups optimize their investment by reducing spin-up time learning how to use the resources.

More detailed information can be found within the CPP form under "Policies" on [the CRC website](https://crc.nd.edu/services/use-our-services/).

### Bulk Purchasing

When the CRC performs large purchases of equipment after retiring aging equipment, there may be opportunites to join the purchase at bulk prices. The CRC will always announce these opportunites through email to the CRC-Users email list.

For any questions contact the CRC via email at <CRCSupport@nd.edu>.

### Grant Proposals

Purchasing dedicated resources through grants is a common procedure to aquire CRC managed HPC resources. The full detailed explaination of the resource allocation policy, including a narrative for inserting into grants, can be found on the [the CRC website](https://crc.nd.edu/services/use-our-services/) within the [Resource Allocation Policy document](https://crc.nd.edu/assets/325829/crc_ra_2019.pdf).
