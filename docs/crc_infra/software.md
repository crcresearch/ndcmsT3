# CRC Software

The CRC provides many precompiled and optimized pieces of software for general use by all users and hosts the license servers for many applications. For details on which pieces of software are available for use on CRC infrastructure, run `module avail`. More detail can be found on the `modules` page.

Popular / highly utilized modules can be found on the toolbar to the left. If you have a specific piece of software in mind, try searching for it in the top left of the toolbar.

Note that most software provided as a module by the CRC will have a limited lifetime. The typical lifetime for a module is typically segmented by maintenance periods (see `maintenance-landing` for more details). For example:

1.  A new Python module is created and released during January 2020 maintenance.
2.  During May 2020 maintenance this Python module is made the default.
3.  During May 2021 maintenance this Python module is moved to deprecated. A newer Python module takes its place as Default.
4.  January 2022 mainteance the example Python module is removed from service.

## User Requested Software

Unfortunately we do not have the human resources at CRC to install individual user requested software applications that are not standard in the RHEL software stack or already part of the core CRC application stack. We would recommend that you try to install the software within your own local AFS space using the installation notes provided by the developers. If you run into serious issues during the installation which cannot be resolved through the documentation, user forums and direct contact with the developers, then please let us know and we will try to provide assistance based on our experience with building packages on our systems. Please see the [CRC Software Policy document](https://crc.nd.edu/services/use-our-services/#Policies) for further details.
