# Training Events

[Udemy](https://nd.udemy.com/), an on-demand and self-paced learning platform, offers a wide variety of individual online courses and can be a great option if you're interested in learning different tools used in research computing, such as [Linux](https://nd.udemy.com/course/linux-command-line-volume1/), [Python](https://nd.udemy.com/course/complete-python-bootcamp/), [R](https://nd.udemy.com/course/r-for-absolute-beginners/), [C++](https://nd.udemy.com/course/beginning-c-plus-plus-programming/), [Github](https://nd.udemy.com/course/git-github-practical-guide/), etc.

Periodically the CRC offers remote [XSEDE](https://www.xsede.org/) workshops and internally sponsored workshops. Look for emails from the CRC for these events.

You may also want to checkout XSEDE's [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTVSqD_elHZtuRv0PKTLOEw) channel which contains recordings of previous workshops.

The CRC will email the user base with information about upcoming workshops and other training events. The library also holds software and data carpentry workshops from time to time, see their [schedule page](https://libcal.library.nd.edu/calendar?cid=447&t=d&d=0000-00-00&cal=447&ct=47504) for more information and to register.
