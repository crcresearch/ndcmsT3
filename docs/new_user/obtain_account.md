# Obtaining a CRC Account

In order to use the CRC systems you must first obtain a CRC account.

To apply for an account with the CRC, complete the steps below:

- You must be signed into your *Notre Dame affliated email account*, for example <crcuser@nd.edu>. If you are not already signed in, open a new tab within your browser and sign into your ND account.
- Once logged in, you can fill out all entries within the [new user form](https://docs.google.com/a/nd.edu/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeeGPVf09NQAzwzQa-RcrDm2X3GeCufq1ObhdzVfLftbUGNsA/viewform) and a CRC account will be created for you. You will be notified via email.

!!! note
    Email is the official line of communication for your CRC account. Be sure you are checking your ND affiliated email account often for any news, updates, or direct communication from CRC staff related to your jobs and account usage.
