## Steps to Getting Help

When you first come across an issue:

  > - For `python`, try installing and using the [pudb](https://pypi.org/project/pudb/) debugger.
  > - For C, C++, Python, Fortran, load the `arm` module and use [ddt](https://developer.arm.com/docs/101136/latest/ddt).

### Setting up an Appointment

After exhausting the steps above, it's time to setup an appointment. The CRC User support staff offer walk in support and phone support, however it is best to schedule an appointment via email. This will ensure an engineer will be available to help you and have a chance to look over your issues beforehand.

- Send an email to <crcsupport@nd.edu> describing your issue.

  > - Include the path to any files you're using within AFS, including:
  >
  >   > - Job script, any driver scripts, source code files, etc. For example:
  >   >
  >   >       ~/research/program/stuff/
  >
  > - Include any error codes or messages you've seen.
  >
  > - Include your availability for a meeting (preferred days/times).

A User Support Engineer will respond and confirm an appointment time and location.
